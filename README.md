# DSA1101 Teaching Materials
Welcome! This public repository hosts all tutorial materials that I created for the NUS course DSA1101: Introduction to Data Science for AY25/26 Semester 2. You'll find slides, code, and additional resources used during the live tutorial. You are encouraged to star this repo to stay updated as new tutorial materials will continue to be added throughout the semester.

## Course Information

## About Github 
I understand that many students who take DSA1101 are relatively new to coding. Github is an essential tool to learn, especially for anyone pursuing a career in tech or working on collaborative coding projects. Hence, I believe this is a great opportunity for students to gain their first exposure to Github even though it's just the basics.

### Getting Started with Github (For Beginners)
If you've never used Github before, don't worry! Here's what you need to know:

**What is Github?**
Github is a platform where people share and collaborate on code. Think of it as Google Drive, but specifically designed for code and documents.

**How to access these materials:**
1. **View online:** You can simply browse all files directly on this webpage with no account needed!
2. **Download everything:** Click the green "Code" button above, then "Download ZIP" to get all materials at once
3. **Download individual files:** Click on any file, then click the "Download" button or "Raw" and save the page
4. **Star this repo:** Click the "Star" button at the top right to bookmark this repository

## Tutorial Content Overview
Materials will be organized by week and topic following this **rough** outline:

1. Introduction to R Programming
2. Introduction to basic probability and statistics
3. Supervised Learning: K-nearest-neighbours, Decision Tree, Regression Analysis, Naive Bayes
4. Diagnostics of Classifiers
5. Model Validation
6. Unsupervised Learning: K-means Clustering, Association Rules

## File Organization
- Materials are organized as: **Week X Tutorial X - [Topic Name]**
- Each folder contains all materials used during that tutorial session (slides, code, datasets, etc.)

## About Tutorial Slides 
- All tutorial slides will be uploaded as PDFs
- Materials will typically be uploaded within 24 hours after each tutorial
- Some animations (including my favorite gifs) and transitions will be lost during the PDF conversion process, so do expect some differences from the slides presented during the actual tutorial
